/* 
Please for the love of god do not use the same architecture 
as the USAI page. Recreating each card on each update caused so many problems.

Create the cards on page load. Add new players if present. 
Then update each card with the new data.



There should be a function that only creates cards. It will be called
on page load and when a new player is seen.
